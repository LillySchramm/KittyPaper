## Features

The current differences between KittyPaper and Paper are:

- `hide-online-players` in `server.properties` is set to `true` by default to enhance player privacy.
- Players are always anonymized in the player sample sent by the server list ping response. 
- Request blocking using the [KittyBlock](https://github.com/LillySchramm/KittyScanBlocklist)

## Configuration

See the Documentation for configuration options: [https://kittypaper.com/docs](https://kittypaper.com/docs)
